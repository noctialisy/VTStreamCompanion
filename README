This is a collection of scripts I started writing down to handle tasks during live streams.
It uses AHKv2 (Auto HotKey) to fire up scripts on specific combinations and can be extended
to support a secondary device like a secondary numpad or a keyboard.

For the moment the available modules are:
    - Vtube Studio (Can trigger any model hotkeys by passing it the hotkey name, ex: Headpats)
    - OBS (Can trigger any OBS function - Requires more development)
    - MixItUp (Can run any command passed as a parameter)
    - Voicemeeter (Can handle muting specific resources, volumes and other stuff - Requires AHK)

The way this app works is that it stays in the background and listens to the keys configured
in MainController/HotkeysDef.ahk to fire scripts in the pythonScripts folder.
All python scripts can also be called individually from something like MixItUp or any other
bot if you don't want to deal with specific keyboard combinations and layouts.

Before starting the AHK script:
    1. Make sure that everything runs on localhost and your firewall is set correctly.
    2. Confirm your endpoints in the settings.default.json file.
    3. Rename settings.default.json to settings.json.
    4. Confirm your hotkeys in MainController/HotkeysDef.Default.ahk
    5. Rename MainController/HotkeysDef.Default.ahk to MainController/HotkeysDef.ahk


Note:
    Interceptor is supported in both the main script and code, but not included in the source
    because of performance reasons, if you want to add Interceptor you can look at their
    specific repo and follow the guide there.


Tech Requirements:
    AHKv2
    Python 3.12+
    MixItUp Bot
    AHKv2 - Interception (Optional for multiple keyboards)
