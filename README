This is a collection of scripts I started writing down to handle tasks during live streams.
It uses AHKv2 (Auto HotKey) to fire up scripts on specific combinations and can be extended
to support a secondary device like a secondary numpad or a keyboard.

For the moment the available modules are:
    - Vtube Studio (Can trigger any model hotkeys by passing it the hotkey name, ex: Headpats)
    - OBS (Can trigger any OBS function - Requires more development)
    - MixItUp (Can run any command passed as a parameter)
    - Voicemeeter (Can handle muting specific resources, volumes and other stuff - Requires AHK)

The way this app works is that it stays in the background and listens to the keys configured
in MainController/MainScript.ahk to fire scripts in the pythonScripts folder.
All python scripts can also be called individually from something like MixItUp or any other
bot if you don't want to deal with specific keyboard combinations and layouts.

All the services should run on localhost only, make sure your firewall is set correctly.
All the configurations and endpoints should be set in the settings.default.json file.
All default configurations should work by default, but you should double check.
Once configured, rename the settings.default.json to settings.json.

Note:
Interceptor is supported in both the main script and code, but not included in the source
because of performance reasons, if you want to add Interceptor you can look at their
specific repo and follow the guide there.


Tech Requirements:
    AHKv2
    Python 3.12+
    MixItUp Bot
    AHKv2 - Interception (Optional for multiple keyboards)
